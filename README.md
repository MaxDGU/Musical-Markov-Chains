# Musical-Markov-Chains
May 2020, IRCAM: applied Markov models to algorithmic composition
MATLAB code for hidden markov model genre classifier and improvisational tool 

‘Stochastic’ implies random variability. Stochastic music is a genre of computer-generated music that generates musical notes randomly under probability distributions. Markov chains are the earliest examples of machine learning and are surprisingly useful mathematical tools in creating interesting computerized music. In this project, done in collaboration with IRCAM (Paris), I investigate the role of Markov Chains compared to other stochastic processes in music-making.
