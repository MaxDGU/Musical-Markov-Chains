# Musical-Markov-Chains
May 2020, IRCAM: applied Markov models to stochastic music
MATLAB code for hidden markov model genre classifier and improvisational tool 

In this project, done in collaboration with IRCAM (Paris), I investigate the role of Markovian Chains and statistics in music-making by creating my own stochastic music generator using multi-order Markov chains and a genre classifier using a Hidden Markov Model.
